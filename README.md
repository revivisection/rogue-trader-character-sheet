## Features

- Display your character's stats in (almost) the same way as you've seen in Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader CRPG
- Multiple sections for character building:
  - Summary: Character origin info, alignment level, history, and biography.
  -  Features: Show off your build by listing abilities & talents that your character has gained throughout the course of the game.
  -  Inventory: Your Rogue Trader's equipment, armour, etc. goes here. 
  -  Relations: Detail the relationship of your Rogue Trader and their retinue members.
  -  Gallery: Place to show off your fanart, commissioned art, fanfics, playlist. Anything goes! 
- Cool floating servo skulls (only visible in certain screen sizes).
- Responsive. Not horrible to look at even in small screens.
